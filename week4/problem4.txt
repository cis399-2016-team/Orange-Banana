For problem four, when we shut down one instance, there was no change and we were able to access our web server using the load balancer without a problem. When we shut down both instances, we got a blank page with nothing on it. When we turned one instance back on, it took the load balancer to notice it, but eventually it started showing that instance again. We restored both instances and it worked normally.
